Step 1: Repo & Data Initialization
======================================

1. Create the Repository
- Go to your GitHub and create a new Public repository named: dynamic-pricing-optimizer.
- Check the box: "Add a README file".
- Select .gitignore template: Python.
- Click Create repository.

2. Clone to your Local Machine
- Open your terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal) and run:
- git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dynamic-pricing-optimizer.git
cd dynamic-pricing-optimizer

3. Build the "Senior" Folder Structure Inside that folder, create these specific folders.
 This structure tells a hiring manager you are organized.
- data/ (for your dataset)
- src/ (for your python scripts)
- notebooks/ (for experimentation)
- tests/ (for automated testing later)

3. Download the Data (For me)
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii
- Click "Download"
- Save the file inside your new data/ folder.
